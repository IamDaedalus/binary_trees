# What is it?
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children  
referred to as the left child and the right child.


# Types of binary trees
There are a many different types of binary trees and below is a list of few of them.
* A rooted binary tree has a root node and every node has at most two children.
* A full binary tree (sometimes referred to as a proper, plane, or strict binary tree)  
  is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.  
* A perfect binary tree is a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children  
  and all leaves have the same depth or same level (the level of a node defined as the  
  number of edges or links from the root node to a node).
